Q4)  Two Dice are rolled, find the probability that sum is
a)	Equal to 1
b)	Less than or equal to 4
c)	Sum is divisible by 2 and  3


Q5)  A bag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn at random. What is the probability that none of the balls drawn is blue?


Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child 
Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)
CHILD	Candies count	Probability
A	1	0.015
B	4	0.20
C	3	0.65
D	5	0.005
E	6	0.01
F	2	0.120
Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.
Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20
